      	  <h1>Open Letter to #NotAgainSU</h1>
          <p>Dear <strong>#NotAgainSU</strong> Participant,</p>
<p>Despite your movement&#8217;s noble and justified origins&mdash;the opposition to racist graffiti, vandalism, and name-calling&mdash;so far, your movement stands to fail, or to succeed in doing harm. With few exceptions, your movement&#8217;s demands work against your mission of &#8220;transparency&#8221; and &#8220;safety&#8221;, and, in some ways, work against a campus culture of mutual respect and acceptance at Syracuse University. Your movement&#8217;s mission statement reinforces the racial divide on campus instead of combating it. For the sake of your good cause, you should reconsider your beliefs about the nature of your movement and whether it actually does good, to be sure that it does good instead of harm.</p>
<p>With the exception of the demand for an &#8220;open forum&#8221; (5, except 5.c) and for &#8220;more counselors&#8221; (just 8.a), your movement&#8217;s demands either hurt your movement&#8217;s mission or make campus culture worse.</p>
<p>Several of the demands compel speech or expression, forcing people to speak or express certain messages or ideas, potentially against their wishes. The demand 5.c would force the Chancellor and members of the Board of Trustees to make updates on issues of your choosing (not theirs) to the students. 13 would force University officials to publish these updates to existing SU media channels and to the new website that you demand. 15 would force University officials to make comment on &#8220;racially-motivated incidents&#8221; by an arbitrary deadline set by you, whether or not they have garnered the facts. All of these demands involve forcing people to speak or express certain messages or ideas in a certain way, whether they believe in them or not, under the threat of your movement. With good reason and wisdom, Professor Peng Gao, in a Daily Orange column, warned campus of your movement&#8217;s similarity to the Cultural Revolutionaries of Mao&#8217;s China, who sought to extort speech and expression from their opponents, and much worse. If you ignore his apt warning and continue down this path, attempting to threaten people into speech and expression, your movement will further degrade the campus culture into one that makes mutual respect and acceptance impossible. Deposed Chancellor Kent Syverud, flanked by <strong>#NotAgainSU</strong> vanguards, confessing his &#8220;unconscious bias&#8221; at the first 5.c. &#8220;open forum&#8221;&mdash;while holding back tears and blinking out &#8220;T-O-R-T-U-R-E&#8221; in Morse code&mdash;would be a sad sight to see. Unfortunately, &#8220;progress&#8221; by your movement means progress in that direction. So you, as a participant in this movement, should reconsider where you want to go.</p>
<p>Confronted with racism on campus, your movement faced a binary choice: seek to punish people or seek to build a better campus culture. Your movement chose the former, punishment. Yes, the University should reprimand vandals, harassers, and anyone who makes threats of violence, racist or otherwise, and yes, the Department of Public Safety should enforce the law with impartiality where the law applies in these cases. However, the scopes of your demands go beyond this to include punishments for speech, expression, and association. Your movement demands that the University punish students for speech or expression that your movement opposes (1 and 4) and that University intervene in Greek Life to force &#8220;equalized treatment&#8221; (14), both to the detriment of &#8220;transparency&#8221; and mutual respect. Threatening people for what they say or express promotes concealment, not &#8220;transparency&#8221;. Picking punishment as your primary tool for change is at odds with establishing a campus culture of mutual respect and acceptance; saying &#8220;censor yourself, or else&#8221; with the promise of punishment will not inspire mutual respect, but feigned compliance (due to the fear of punishment), non-cooperation, and even intentional subversion of your movement&#8217;s agenda. These are all the ill effects of your movement&#8217;s demands to punish on the basis of speech, expression, and association; they help neither your mission of &#8220;transparency&#8221; and &#8220;safety&#8221; nor the campus culture.</p>
<p>Someone defending <strong>#NotAgainSU</strong> might say demands 2 and 12&mdash;the ones for &#8220;reform&#8221; of SEM 100 (an introductory acculturation course for first-year and transfer students) and &#8220;a minimum of $1 million&#8221; to fund it&mdash;offer a non-punitive way to improve campus culture. This is just not so. If your movement sought to make SEM 100 voluntary instead of mandatory, that would demonstrate an unequivocal commitment to a culture of mutual respect and acceptance. It would mean&mdash;you respect people enough to trust them to choose whether to attend your version of SEM 100, and that you accept if they choose differently than how you would choose for them. This would be a culture of mutual respect and acceptance. On the other hand, your movement seeks to force people to attend, revealing distrust&mdash;and the belief that people must be forced to do the right thing. Demands 3 and 7 follow this theme of distrust and force, making additional offers for indoctrination that people cannot refuse, while offering no respect or acceptance to anyone who wishes to abstain.</p>
<p>Demands 17 and 18, though unrelated in their purposes, both detract from the movement&#8217;s credibility as a virtuous force for reform at Syracuse University. Demand 17 outlines the systematic plundering of University wealth to benefit unaccountable outside interests. One struggles to imagine how anyone with the interests of Syracuse University in mind could propose such a harmful reform. The straightforward explanation for this is that <strong>#NotAgainSU</strong> does not have the interests of Syracuse University in mind. Demand 18&mdash;&#8220;the university agrees that there will be no consequences or sanctions arising for students
who are participating in the sit in as a result of their participation in the sit in.&#8221;&mdash;comes straight from the coup d&#8217;Ã©tat repertoire of dictators: take power, then secure ex post facto legalization of all crimes required to take power. Both demands 17 and 18 appear insidious in their own way; both detract from the credibility of your movement; so both hurt the movement&#8217;s ability to forward its mission.</p>
<p>Of all your movement&#8217;s demands, the ones for race separatism and race favoritism do the most to imperil a culture of mutual respect and acceptance. &#8220;Our children and grandchildren may yet curse the day we began hyping race and ethnicity. There are countries where that has led to slaughters in the streets but you cannot name a country where it has led to greater harmony.&#8221; Thomas Sowell offered this warning, calling attention to the long term risks any society faces if it overemphasizes race and identity. This warning is meant to dissuade anyone from pursuing race separatism, like your movement does with demands 6, 8, and 9, or race favoritism, which your movement calls for in demands 2, 8, 10, 11, and 16.</p>
<p>Demand 6 calls on the University to offer and promote roommate and residence selection on the basis of race and ethnicity (&#8220;look&#8221; and &#8220;identity&#8221;). In specific, 6.a demands that the University &#8220;give students of color the option of being surrounded by other students who look like them&#8221;. Demand 8 calls for race separatism in counseling, 8.d requiring &#8220;photos of counselors, or
indicators regarding their identities, enabling students to request a therapist with similar identities&#8221;. Demand 9 calls for a whole separate building to house offices &#8220;for students of color&#8221;, a testament to your movement&#8217;s extremism on race separation. These demands would reinforce separation and unfamiliarity between different racial and ethnic groups on campus. Instead of fostering a culture where each person respects and accepts his or her fellow human beings, they would bring division from separation and distrust from unfamiliarity.</p>
<p>The demands 2, 8, 10, 11, and 16 each advocate race favoritism across several domains. In brief, 2 and 8 demand race-based hiring; 10 seeks race-based scholarships and aid; 10 and 11 call for race-based admission; and 15 would require the Chancellor to give a speech each year regarding the &#8220;student of color experience&#8221;. Each and every demand for special treatment based on race amounts to a bit more distance in the racial divide, forestalling a future where that divide closes and a shared sense of unity and camaraderie replaces it. A future of harmonious difference and shared unity is one we should all hope for, but sadly not one your movement brings any closer in its current form. Like many of its demands, the movement&#8217;s mission statement itself serves as a reinforcement of racial division:</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>#NotAgainSU</strong>, a Black student-led movement, believes transparency from the administration is necessary. The safety of students - specifically the safety of underrepresented and underserved students - is paramount. <strong>#NotAgainSU</strong> stands in solidarity with all groups and communities that identify with and for the movement.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Besides typical capitalizations, the mission statement&#8217;s authors chose to capitalize &#8220;Black&#8221;. With nothing else out of the ordinary capitalized, this choice symbolizes, regardless of intent, the elevation of race. It says that &#8220;Black&#8221; is an institution in the same way that &#8220;Syracuse University&#8221; is an institution, but that &#8220;students&#8221; (lowercase) are not. Moreover, the movement&#8217;s description as &#8220;a Black &#8230; movement&#8221; implies that race supersedes thought and ideas in the following sense: the movement does not represent the thought and ideas of black people who oppose it, but the movement claims to speak for them or in their best interest anyway&mdash;on the basis of race alone. In some ways, group political action empowers, but in other ways, it suppresses.</p>
<p>Your peers in the movement, your movement&#8217;s advisors, or you yourself might hear or raise a number of objections to this letter. Without a doubt, valid objections may be found, but&mdash;the letter is not worth reading, the letter is racist, and the letter itself being in opposition means the movement is good&mdash;are not among them. To the first, any movement stands to gain from considering the criticism as well as the praise. Praise sounds nice and might offer inspiration and motivation, but to hear only praise and to shut out opposing ideas blinds any movement to its own flaws and weaknesses, and to new opportunities. The objection that this letter is a product of resentment or racism&mdash;or that this letter represents fear of black people having political power&mdash;is an understandable but, in this case, baseless suspicion. This suspicion is understandable because some people do fear black people having political power, and some of your critics are critical because they are racists. However, this suspicion applied to this letter is baseless. Not every one of your critics is a fearful racist (optimistically, many are not). This critic hopes for the triumph of anti-racism, the defeat of racists, and a shared future of mutual respect and acceptance for all people, at Syracuse University and everywhere else. This letter&#8217;s criticism arises from the belief that <strong>#NotAgainSU</strong>, in its current demands and form, does harm to its own cause and leads us away from a just future of peace and harmony. Lastly, to the idea that the letter being in opposition to the movement means that the movement is good&mdash;both the good and the bad face opposition. Reacting to opposition is no shortcut to moral truth. Whether or not your movement faces opposition does not tell whether it is good. Aspects of your movement are good or bad, but you must evaluate them to know which is which.</p>
<p>In short, your cause (anti-racism) is good, and some of your opponents are indeed bad, but your demands (with minute exceptions) and mission statement will not help the cause, and in some ways, go against it and hurt campus culture at Syracuse University. The good news is that it&#8217;s your movement. The power is yours to reconsider anything you want and make it better if you choose.</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>
